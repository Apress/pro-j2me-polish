<!--
Some MIDP 2.0 devices do not support the menu mode, since they do not forward key
events when a soft key is pressed. J2ME Polish determines whether a device supports the menu
mode by evaluating the device database. When the hasCommandKeyEvents feature is set, the
device supports the pure MIDP 2.0 menu mode. Additionally, you can set the capabilities
key.LeftSoftKey and key.RightSoftKey to define the key codes for the soft keys (these are the
values that are reported to the keyPressed() method of a Canvas). When no keys are defined,
the value -6 is assumed for the left soft key and the value -7 for the right soft key. Listing 12-4
shows the definition of the Siemens/CX65 phone that includes these settings.
