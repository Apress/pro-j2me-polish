<!-- Loading Ant properties is a handy way to make your script flexible
     when several members of your team are using it.
     In the following example the file ${user-name}-build.properties
     is loaded. When your user name is "robot" then robot-build.properties
     are loaded.
-->

<project name="example" default="showpaths">
	<property file="${user.name}-build.properties" />
	<property name="wtk.home" location="C:\WTK22" />
	<property name="polish.home" location="C:\programs\J2ME-Polish" />
	<target name="showpaths">
		<echo message="wtk.home=${wtk.home}" />
		<echo message="polish.home=${polish.home}" />
	</target>
</project>
