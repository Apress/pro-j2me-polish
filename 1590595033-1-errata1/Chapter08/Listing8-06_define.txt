// You can define temporary symbols which ease the handling of complex terms a lot:

//#if config.useFullScreen && (polish.midp2 || polish.classes.fullscreen:defined)
	//#define tmp.useFullScreen
	//#define tmp.message = Hello fullscreen World!
//#else
	//#define tmp.message = Hello World!
//#endif


// later onwards you can check the temporary symbol instead of the complete term:

//#if tmp.useFullScreen
	System.out.println( "FullScreen activated!" );
//#endif
